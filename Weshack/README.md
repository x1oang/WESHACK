Our project is to make a website that talks about space, we used HTML and CSS and JS to link everything, using canvas to DRAW the blackholes and planets, we did not use and png's or GIF, However we fully relied on code (JavaScript To Code 2D Animations.) to do it.
The HTML is linked to other JS and CSS to make the animations and image.
